### Content

The goal of this project is to provide an open source solution for staff
vacation planning. Furthermore I try to write a highly configurable tool
collection to enable everybody fitting their needs.

### Technics

This software is capable of running on multiple platforms due to it's
ussage of Java/Swing. It's developed and tested under UNIX like operating
systems but runs under Windows too. Please note that using openjdk instead
of the oracle one will improve your user experience. Running the server
software under UNIX (for example FreeBSD or Linux) will also save you some
trouble.

### Compiling

Simply type ant within the toplevel directory of the repository you just
cloned and you're good to go.
